        <p>Hello! my name is Abass Johnson Koroma and i am from Sierra Leone, Makeni City. I'm excited to be a part of
            this class. Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a range of hobbies and interests that keep me engaged.
            I'm an avid hiker and find solace in exploring nature trails during my free time. Additionally, I have a
            deep passion for photography and often combine it with my hiking adventures to capture the beauty of the
            outdoors. On the personal front, I come from a close-knit family with two younger siblings who constantly
            keep me on my toes.
            In this class, I hope to gain a comprehensive understanding of build a websites. Specifically, I'm eager to
            learn about how website can host different servers. I believe that programming is not just a buzzword but a
            powerful tool that drives innovation and change.</p>
